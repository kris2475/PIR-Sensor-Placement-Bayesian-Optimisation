# PIR-Sensor-Placement-Bayesian-Optimisation
Python script using Bayesian Optimisation (skopt) to find the optimal 2D placement of directional PIR sensors for maximum room coverage. Features a robust objective function considering range, cone angle, obstacles, and a matplotlib visualisation of the resulting sensor layout and covered area.
