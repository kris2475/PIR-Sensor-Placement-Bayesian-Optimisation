# üöÄ Sensor Placement Optimisation for AI-Informed Radiant Heating Control (Swansea Bay Net-Zero)

## üéØ Project Overview
This repository documents a critical comparative study on optimising the placement of directional Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors. The project is a foundational element for developing an AI-informed heating control system that drives maximal energy efficiency in modern buildings.

The goal was to determine the most effective and efficient optimisation algorithm (**Differential Evolution vs. Bayesian Optimisation**) for maximising sensor coverage in complex, obstructed spaces while ensuring line-of-sight (LoS) constraints are respected.

The successful implementation of this research directly supports **Swansea Bay's Net-Zero Drive** by enabling highly granular, predictive control over advanced radiant heating systems, significantly curtailing energy wastage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology: Optimisation Algorithm Benchmark & Results
I compared two leading global optimisation techniques‚Äî**Differential Evolution (DE)** and **Bayesian Optimisation (BO)**‚Äîusing an identical, highly realistic objective function.  
This rigorous approach ensured a robust benchmark focusing on **solution quality** and crucial **computational cost**.

Both algorithms include **ray‚Äìobstacle checks**, preventing PIR cones from unrealistically ‚Äúseeing through walls.‚Äù

### 1. The Objective Function (The Sensor Model)
The objective function simulates a real-world sensor network, representing the performance of a self-powered IoT wireless sensor mesh.  
The function seeks to **MAXIMISE the total covered floor area** by minimizing the negative coverage score.

### 2. Optimisation Algorithms Benchmarked and Conclusion
We used a **practical, reduced budget** to directly test the wall-clock efficiency of the algorithms.

## üõë Analysis of Efficiency: Why Bayesian Optimisation Failed
While BO is designed for **sample efficiency** (fewer calls to the objective function), the **high dimensionality** of the problem (15 parameters) meant that the overhead of fitting and updating the **Gaussian Process model** was disproportionately expensive.
