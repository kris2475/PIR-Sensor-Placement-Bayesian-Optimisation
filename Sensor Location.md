# Sensor Location: The Unsung Hero of Swansea Bay‚Äôs Net-Zero Drive

The journey to **Net-Zero** starts with intelligence‚Äîand in a smart building, intelligence is entirely dependent on **sensor location**.

---

## Why Sensor Location Matters
In Net-Zero buildings across the **Swansea Bay City Region**, advanced systems like **radiant heating** depend on flawless **occupancy data**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Poor sensor placement can lead to:  
- Blind spots  
- False vacancy readings  
- Ghost occupancy  

Each of these issues translates directly into **wasted energy**.

---

## The Case for Optimisation
Recent **PIR sensor optimisation research** highlights the importance of placement:  

- Precisely locating **directional sensors** in complex, obstructed spaces  
- Ensuring **100% data confidence**  
- Respecting real-world **Line-of-Sight (LoS)** constraints  

This high-quality, reliable data is the only way to enable **AI systems** to accurately predict future occupancy.

---

## From Responsive to Predictive
With predictive capability, smart systems can:  
- **Pre-heat accurately** before occupancy  
- **Shut down proactively** to save energy  

This directly addresses the problem of **thermal inertia** in advanced heating systems, which otherwise wastes energy.

## The Takeaway
Optimised sensor placement is not optional‚Äîit is **the foundation of Net-Zero efficiency**.  

It transforms a smart building from merely **responsive** to truly **predictive**, ensuring operational excellence in the path to sustainability.  

üëâ It‚Äôs not enough to have sensors‚Äî**they must be placed perfectly**.
