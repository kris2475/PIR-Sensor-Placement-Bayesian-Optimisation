Sensor Location: The Unsung Hero of Swansea Bay’s Net-Zero Drive
The journey to Net-Zero starts with intelligence, and in a smart building, intelligence is entirely dependent on sensor location.

In Net-Zero buildings across the Swansea Bay City Region, systems like highly efficient radiant heating rely on flawless occupancy data. Arbitrary sensor placement leads to 'blind spots,' false vacancy readings, or ghost occupancy—all of which translate directly into wasted energy.

This is why optimisation is vital. As demonstrated by the recent PIR sensor optimisation research, precisely locating directional sensors in complex, obstructed spaces ensures 100% data confidence by respecting real-world Line-of-Sight (LoS) constraints. This high-quality, reliable data is the only thing that enables AI to predict future occupancy accurately.

This predictive capability allows systems to pre-heat accurately and shut-down proactively, conquering the energy-wasting thermal inertia inherent in advanced heating systems. Optimised sensor placement transforms a smart building from merely responsive to truly predictive, making it the non-negotiable foundation for achieving operational Net-Zero efficiency. It’s not enough to have sensors—they must be placed perfectly.
